# Clients and Sample Code

The PDF Converter Services Online uses a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) file to describe the facilities exposed by the REST API. The main advantage of using Swagger is that it can be used to generate wrappers / proxies / clients for an [absolutely staggering](http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/) number of languages, servers and platforms.

It is easy to [generate your own clients](http://editor.swagger.io), but we have done the work for you, including easy to follow sample code, for the most popular languages. 

- [C# Libraries and sample code](v1/csharp/)
- [Curl sample code](v1/curl/)
- [Java Libraries and sample code](v1/java/)
- [JavaScript Libraries and sample code](v1/javascript/)
- [Generic JSON sample code](v1/json/)
- [PHP Libraries and sample code](v1/php/)
- [Python Libraries and sample code](v1/python/)
- [Ruby Libraries and sample code](v1/ruby/)
