# Sample - Merge SharePoint Files and HTML to PDF using JavaScript

The sample provided in this section uses the [*Muhimbi PDF Converter Services Online*](https://github.com/Muhimbi/PDF-Converter-Services-Online) to convert (if needed) and merge multiple files, and HTML, into a single PDF. This is somewhat similar to our [other merge example](../merge_to_pdf) with the main differentiator being that in this example we only pass in the (SharePoint Online) paths to the files to convert and merge. This makes it easier to merge a large number of files in a single operation.

Additional sample code to *convert, merge, watermark, secure* and *OCR* files [can be found here](../).

Full details about the `merge_to_pdf` method, fields and properties can be found [in the Wiki](https://github.com/Muhimbi/PDF-Converter-Services-Online/wiki/API:-merge_to_pdf).
