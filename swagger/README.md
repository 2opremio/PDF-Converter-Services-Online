# Swagger - API Definition

The PDF Converter Services Online uses a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) file to describe the facilities exposed by the REST API. The main advantage of using Swagger is that it can be used to generate wrappers / proxies / clients for an [absolutely staggering](http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/) number of languages, servers and platforms.

Pre-generated clients and sample code for the most popular platforms [can be found here](../clients/v1/).

If your platform is not listed then you can generate your own client using [editor.swagger.io](http://editor.swagger.io) or [Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
